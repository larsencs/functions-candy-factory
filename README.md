## About The Project
This was an assignment given during coding bootcamp.

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to further solidify how objects behave in Javascript, and how new key-value pairs can be assigned to them. This app simulates the making of chocolate bark by taking in new key-value pairs via different functions, some with conditionals, and then returing the finished object.
